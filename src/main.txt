  testvalve.ino/cpp - Test programme for the AIR/WATER/GAS Ball Valves 
  This one designed around the U.S.SOLID 5 Wire 
  USS-MSV00015 5 Wire Model with Full OPEN/CLOSED Status 
  Functionality requires the addition of a standard DPDT Relay module
  and 24VDC power supply

// New Instance (RelayGPIOpin, openStatusGPIOpin, closeStatusGPIOpin, useInternalPullups,PowerRelayGPIOpin)
// Following the Youtube video above as part of this project The GPIO Pins would be 16,17, and 18.  The ESP32 has
// Internal pull-up resistors so the next option is set to true, if you device does not, you can set to false and 
// Use pull up resistors for the connections on 17 and 18.  If you are using internal pullups, set the next value 
// to true, if you are supplying your own pull up resistors for the last 2 values, cloose false. Finally, If you 
// wish to have the power supply [24vdc] that you must supply, controlled by the esp32, to be energized only during
// open and close operations, you must supply a SPST relay and that relay's GPIO pin here.  If no value the program 
// will assume no Power relay.

// MOTOR RELAY ON 16
// OPEN/CLOSE SENSE on 17&18
// USE INTERNAL PULLUPS [ESP32]
// NO POWER SUPPLY RELAY

// If the time taken should exceed this value, an ERROR will be returned as a statusn through the valve still might 
// have eventually reached the full position.  This can be seperately polled later to see if it is stuck with the
// getValvePosition function.  Your program should incorperate this polling or alarm on error.
